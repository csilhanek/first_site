            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Banana</h2>
            <img src = "images/banana.jpeg" width = 400 alt = "A small round yellow bird"/>

            <p>The pet is a budgie, a wonderfully social and cool animal. Initially, the bird might be a bit scared and require training. This process usually takes about 2 weeks of gradual interaction within its cage to help it become comfortable and accustomed to your presence. Afterward, you can progress to more direct approaches like placing your hand on the cage and offering treats from your hand.Once they've grown comfortable, the experience becomes quite enjoyable. Budgies thrive on social interaction and attention, delighting in playtime and engaging with people. They're open to learning tricks and can even be taught to talk due to their intelligence.</p>
            <p>Budgies make fantastic pets; they're incredibly cute and delightful to observe. However, they can be a bit chirpy, especially in the mornings, which might be a bit bothersome. Yet, this is just their way of seeking attention and expressing themselves positively. As companions, budgies are truly rewarding. Building a bond with them requires time and patience, but the process is well worth it. Once they grow comfortable with you, the satisfaction of training and connecting with them is truly fulfilling.</p>
