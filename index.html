            <p>This meal is a cheap and easy alternative to the classic cheap college meal: ramen noodles. It cooks up in about 10
            minutes, and offers a ton of flavor and a more filling alternative to the typical packaged food. There is also plenty of
            room for culinary freedom and expression by adding extra sauces or spices, and substituting the pork for something like
            chicken for a healthier protein option.</p>
